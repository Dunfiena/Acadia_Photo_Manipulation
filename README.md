## How it works ##

### Color Manipulation ###

There is two settings, grey and colour manipulation.  Both work the same way, you set the lower and upper limmits of the pixel values and replace everything outside that range

### Threshold Manipulation ###
Much like the color manipulation, the idea is to have a lower and upper limit and a swell to remove color.  The swell around the removed area is controlled by the the number of pixels
chosen.
